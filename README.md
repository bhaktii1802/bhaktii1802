## 🚀 About Me
I'm an aspiring Data Scientist!


# Hi, I'm Bhakti! 👋
###  💡 ML Problem Solver | 🧠  Deep Learning + Domain Expertise | Making Neural Nets Think Smarter

Hello! I’m passionate about machine learning, deep learning, and computer vision. I specialize in building hybrid models that combine traditional ML techniques with deep learning architectures to solve real-world problems effectively. My expertise includes image classification, model optimization, and improving accuracy using CNNs, VGG16, PCA, and XGBoost. I enjoy experimenting with transfer learning, dimensionality reduction, and ensemble methods to enhance model performance. With a strong focus on computer vision, I aim to develop efficient, scalable, and high-performing models that make a measurable impact.
